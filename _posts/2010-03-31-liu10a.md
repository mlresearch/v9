title: The Group Dantzig Selector
abstract: We introduce a new method – the  group Dantzig selector – for high dimensional
  sparse regression with  group structure, which has a convincing theory about why
  utilizing the group structure can be beneficial. Under a  group restricted isometry
  condition, we obtain a significantly improved nonasymptotic $\ell_2$-norm bound over
  the basis pursuit or the Dantzig selector which ignores the group structure.   To
  gain more insight, we also introduce a surprisingly simple and intuitive  “sparsity
  oracle condition” to obtain a block $\ell_1$-norm bound, which is easily accessible to
  a broad audience in machine learning community. Encouraging numerical results are
  also provided to support our theory.
