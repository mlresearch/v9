title: Inference of Sparse Networks with Unobserved Variables. Application to Gene
  Regulatory Networks
abstract: Networks are becoming a unifying framework for modeling complex systems
  and network inference problems are frequently encountered in many fields. Here,
  I develop and apply a generative approach to network inference (RCweb) for the case
  when the network is sparse and the latent (not observed) variables affect the observed
  ones. From all possible factor analysis (FA) decompositions explaining the variance
  in the data, RCweb selects the FA decomposition that is consistent with a sparse
  underlying network. The sparsity constraint is imposed by a novel method that significantly
  outperforms (in terms of accuracy, robustness to noise, complexity scaling and computational
  efficiency) methods using l1 norm relaxation such as K-SVD and l1-based sparse principle
  component analysis (PCA). Results from simulated models demonstrate that RCweb recovers
  exactly the model structures for sparsity as low (as non-sparse) as 50% and with
  ratio of unobserved to observed variables as high as 2. RCweb is robust to noise,
  with gradual decrease in the parameter ranges as the noise level increases.
