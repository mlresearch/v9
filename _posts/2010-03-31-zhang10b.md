title: Bayesian Online Learning for Multi-label and Multi-variate Performance Measures
abstract: Many real world applications employ multi-variate performance measures and
  each example can belong to multiple classes. The currently most popular approaches
  train an SVM for each class, followed by ad hoc thresholding.  Probabilistic models
  using Bayesian decision theory are also commonly adopted.  In this paper, we propose
  a Bayesian online multi-label classification framework (BOMC) which learns a probabilistic
  linear classifier. The likelihood is modeled by a graphical model similar to TrueSkill$^\text{TM}$,
  and inference is based on Gaussian density filtering with expectation propagation.  Using
  samples from the posterior, we label the testing data by maximizing the expected
  $F_1$-score. Our experiments on Reuters1-v2 dataset show BOMC compares favorably
  to the state-of-the-art online learners in macro-averaged $F_1$-score and training
  time.
