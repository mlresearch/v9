title: Gaussian processes with monotonicity information
abstract: A method for using monotonicity information in multivariate Gaussian process
  regression and classification is proposed. Monotonicity information is introduced
  with virtual derivative observations, and the resulting posterior is approximated
  with expectation propagation. Behaviour of the method is illustrated with artificial
  regression examples, and the method is used in a real world health care classification
  problem to include monotonicity information with respect to one of the covariates.
