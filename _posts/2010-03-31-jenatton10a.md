title: Structured Sparse Principal Component Analysis
abstract: We present an extension of sparse PCA, or sparse dictionary learning, where
  the sparsity patterns of all dictionary elements are structured and constrained
  to belong to a prespecified set of shapes. This structured sparse PCA is based on
  a structured regularization recently introduced by Jenatton et al.(2009). While
  classical sparse priors only deal with cardinality, the regularization we use encodes
  higher-order information about the data. We propose an efficient and simple optimization
  procedure to solve this problem. Experiments with two practical tasks, the denoising
  of sparse structured signals and face recognition, demonstrate the benefits of the
  proposed structured approach over unstructured approaches.
