title: 'Convex Structure Learning in Log-Linear Models: Beyond Pairwise Potentials'
abstract: Previous work has examined structure learning in log-linear models with
  $\ell_1$-regularization, largely focusing on the case of pairwise potentials.  In this
  work we consider the case of models with potentials of arbitrary order, but that
  satisfy a hierarchical constraint.  We enforce the hierarchical constraint using
  group $\ell_1$-regularization with overlapping groups, and an active set method that enforces
  hierarchical inclusion allows us to tractably consider the exponential number of
  higher-order potentials.  We use a spectral projected gradient method as a sub-routine
  for solving the overlapping group $\ell_1$-regularization problem, and make use of a sparse
  version of Dykstraâ€™s algorithm to compute the projection.  Our experiments indicate
  that this model gives equal or better test set likelihood compared to previous models.
