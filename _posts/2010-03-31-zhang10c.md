title: Multi-Task Learning using Generalized t Process
abstract: Multi-task learning seeks to improve the generalization performance of a
  learning task with the help of other related learning tasks.  Among the multi-task
  learning methods proposed thus far, Bonilla et al.’s method provides a novel multi-task
  extension of Gaussian process (GP) by using a task covariance matrix to model the
  relationships between tasks. However, learning the task covariance matrix directly
  has both computational and representational drawbacks. In this paper, we propose
  a Bayesian extension by modeling the task covariance matrix as a random matrix with
  an inverse-Wishart prior and integrating it out to achieve Bayesian model averaging.
  To make the computation feasible, we first give an alternative weight-space view
  of Bonilla et al.’s multi-task GP model and then integrate out the task covariance
  matrix in the model, leading to a multi-task generalized t process (MTGTP). For
  the likelihood, we use a generalized t noise model which, together with the generalized
  t process prior, brings about the robustness advantage as well as an analytical
  form for the marginal likelihood.  In order to specify the inverse-Wishart prior,
  we use the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) statistic to estimate the parameter matrix
  of the inverse-Wishart prior. Moreover, we investigate some theoretical properties
  of MTGTP, such as its asymptotic analysis and learning curve. Comparative experimental
  studies on two common multi-task learning applications show very promising results.
