title: Sufficient Dimension Reduction via Squared-loss Mutual Information Estimation
abstract: "The goal of sufficient dimension reduction in supervised learning is to
  find the lowdimensional subspace of input features that is \x1Asufficient\x1A for
  predicting output values. In this paper, we propose a novel sufficient dimension
  reduction method using a squaredloss variant of mutual information as a dependency
  measure. We utilize an analytic approximator of squared-loss mutual information
  based on density ratio estimation, which is shown to possess suitable convergence
  properties. We then develop a natural gradient algorithm for sufficient subspace
  search. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method compares favorably with
  existing dimension reduction approaches."
