title: Sufficient Dimension Reduction via Squared-loss Mutual Information Estimation
abstract: 'The goal of sufficient dimension reduction in supervised learning is to
  find the low dimensional subspace of input features that is "sufficient" for
  predicting output values. In this paper, we propose a novel sufficient dimension
  reduction method using a squared-loss variant of mutual information as a dependency
  measure. We utilize an analytic approximator of squared-loss mutual information
  based on density ratio estimation, which is shown to possess suitable convergence
  properties. We then develop a natural gradient algorithm for sufficient subspace
  search. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method compares favorably with
  existing dimension reduction approaches.'
