title: Fast Active-set-type Algorithms for $l1$-regularized Linear Regression
abstract: In this paper, we investigate new active-set-type methods for l1-regularized
  linear regression that overcome some difficulties of existing active set methods.
  By showing a relationship between $l1$-regularized linear regression and the linear
  complementarity problem with bounds, we present a fast active-set-type method, called
  block principal pivoting. This method accelerates computation by allowing exchanges
  of several variables among working sets. We further provide an improvement of this
  method, discuss its properties, and also explain a connection to the structure learning
  of Gaussian graphical models. Experimental comparisons on synthetic and real data
  sets show that the proposed method is significantly faster than existing active
  set methods and competitive against recently developed iterative methods.
