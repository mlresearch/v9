title: 'Hartigan’s Method: k-means Clustering without Voronoi'
abstract: 'Hartigan’s method for $k$-means clustering is the following greedy heuristic:
  select a point, and optimally reassign it.  This paper develops two other formulations
  of the heuristic, one leading to a number of consistency properties, the other showing
  that the data partition is always quite separated from the induced Voronoi partition.  A
  characterization of the volume of this separation is provided.  Empirical tests
  verify not only good optimization performance relative to Lloyd’s method, but also
  good running time.'
