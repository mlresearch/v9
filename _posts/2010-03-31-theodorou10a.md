title: Learning Policy Improvements with Path Integrals
abstract: With the goal to generate more scalable algorithms with higher efficiency
  and fewer open parameters, reinforcement learning (RL) has recently moved towards
  combining classical techniques from optimal control and dynamic programming with
  modern learning techniques from statistical estimation theory. In this vein, this
  paper suggests to use the framework of stochastic optimal control with path integrals
  to derive a novel approach to RL with parametrized policies. While solidly grounded
  in value function estimation and optimal control based on the stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
  (HJB) equations, policy improvements can be transformed into an approximation problem
  of a path integral which has no open parameters other than the exploration noise.
  The resulting algorithm can be conceived of as model-based, semi-model-based, or
  even model free, depending on how the learning problem is structured.   Our new
  algorithm demonstrates interesting similarities with previous RL research in the
  framework of probability matching and provides intuition why the slightly heuristically
  motivated probability matching approach can actually perform well. Empirical evaluations
  demonstrate significant performance improvements over gradient-based policy learning
  and scalability to high-dimensional control problems.  We believe that Policy  Improvement
  with   Path  Integrals  PI^2 offers currently one of the most efficient, numerically
  robust, and easy to implement algorithms for RL based on trajectory roll-outs.
