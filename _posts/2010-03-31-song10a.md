title: Nonparametric Tree Graphical Models
abstract: We introduce a nonparametric representation for graphical model on trees
  which expresses  marginals as Hilbert space embeddings and conditionals as embedding
  operators.  This formulation allows us to define a graphical model solely  on the
  basis of the feature space representation of its variables. Thus, this nonparametric
  model can be applied to general domains where kernels are defined, handling challenging
  cases such as discrete variables whose domains are huge, or very complex, non-Gaussian
  continuous distributions. We also derive kernel belief propagation, a Hilbert-space
  algorithm for performing inference in our model.  We show that our method outperforms
  state-of-the-art techniques  in a cross-lingual document retrieval task and  a camera
  rotation estimation problem.
