title: Identifying Cause and Effect on Discrete Data using Additive Noise Models
abstract: Inferring the causal structure of a set of random variables from a finite
  sample of the joint distribution is an important problem in science. Recently, methods
  using additive noise models have been suggested to approach the case of continuous
  variables. In many situations, however, the variables of interest are discrete or
  even have only finitely many states. In this work we extend the notion of additive
  noise models to these cases. Whenever the joint distribution $\mathbf{P}^{(X,Y)}$ admits such
  a model in one direction, e.g. $Y = f(X)+N$, $N \perp \!\!\! \perp X$, it does not admit the
  reversed model  $X=g(Y)+\tilde{N}$, $\tilde{N} \perp \!\!\! \perp Y$ as long as the model is chosen in
  a generic way. Based on these deliberations we propose an efficient new algorithm
  that is able to distinguish between cause and effect for a finite sample of discrete
  variables. We show that this algorithm works both on synthetic and real data sets.
