title: Descent Methods for Tuning Parameter Refinement
abstract: This paper addresses multidimensional tuning parameter selection in the
  context of “train-validate-test” and K-fold cross validation.  A coarse grid search
  over tuning parameter space is used to initialize a descent method which then jointly
  optimizes over variables and tuning parameters.  We study four regularized regression
  methods and develop the update equations for the corresponding descent algorithms.  Experiments
  on both simulated and real-world datasets show that the method results in significant
  tuning parameter refinement.
