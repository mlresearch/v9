title: Optimal Allocation Strategies for the Dark Pool Problem
abstract: We study the problem of allocating stocks to dark pools. We propose and
  analyze an optimal approach for allocations, if continuous-valued allocations are
  allowed. We also propose a modification for the case when only integer-valued allocations
  are possible. We extend the previous work on this problem (Ganchev et al., 2009)
  to adversarial scenarios, while also improving over their results in the iid
  setup. The resulting algorithms are efficient, and perform well in simulations
  under stochastic and adversarial inputs.
